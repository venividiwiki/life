# Finding a new goal

This page helps you find a new goal for life. Think about what that means for a second.
If this page is successful in giving you a new goal, which aligns with the authors interests, another human will dedicate a significant amount of work towards this goal.

So please recognise, that when you ask other people what to do in life, you will mostly get answers which align with the goals of the person you asked.

For me writing this page was an interesting experience, because I had to think about my goals for writing this page.
Thats why I would like to give you another task.

## Task

If a significant amount of people would ask you what they should do in life, what would you say?

## Inspiration for goals
  
My top goal right now is to help people with living their lives. This goal comes from an experience I made. 
After about half of my school experience I basically decided, that I wanted to become a video game developer.
This decision was made, because I spent most of my time playing the product of their work.
I soon started to watch some YouTube tutorials for learning Java and programmed along.
  
When looking back at this I see that I accomplished an unusual thing (learning Java at a relatively young age) just by having a long term goal.
Surprise: I didn't become a video game developer after all, because my goals shifted later.
Being able to write code has been a very great asset later in life and I am very glad that I learned it.
  
On the other hand playing video games was becoming a dangerous addiction for me. When I had free time I almost always played video games.
Sometimes 12 hours and more in a day. 
Now I only play games with friends for 3-4 hours distributed over two weeks.
  
I think it is an essential part of the human experience, that priorities are shifting over time.
It is also natural that with every shift of priorities the probability is high, that some activities we spent much time on become meaningless and feel like a waste.
When we evaluate what we are doing now with the priorities we had before we might also be disappointed.
My 12 year old self would probably think that my life is boring, while I think that most of his time was wasted on video games.
  
I am glad that there was a system in place which forced my younger self to learn the basics of many fields, 
because I am unsure if I would have ever done something other than playing games.
I didn't like school but having a system in place in which you advance gives you a clear outlook for your future and you can feel safe,
that if you just advance in it, your life will probably become alright.
  
I want this wiki to help you in similar situations and also give you a path you can follow.
If this goal seems to align well with you, I recommend that you start with a PR :)

## Other goal inspirations

A nice trick if you don't know your goal is to follow convergent instrumental goals.
I like how Robert Miles speaks about this in a video on Artificial Intelligence. 
Be careful to limit the the time of your YouTube journey: https://youtu.be/ZeecOKBus3Q?t=143
  
If you find your terminal goal at a later point in time it is very likely that the instrumental
goals you tried to achieve before have a positive impact on it.
  
I would add to the list in the video: Fame and Influence/Power.
