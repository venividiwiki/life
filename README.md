# life

In this repo I am trying to write the documentation for life as a whole.

## Quick Start

Life is so intuitive that you are already using it right now
You will need no installation guide and honestly you will probably be just fine without reading any documentation.

One of the major problems with life can be the absurdly large amount of features implemented.
This makes it really tedious to write documentation for everything and therefore I need your help.

## Contribution

If you want to change something just open a PR. There are some rules:

1. Every article contains only two links. These are at the end of the page and are in the form of a decision.
2. Every article can be read in under 10 min.
3. Every article is friendly

## Decision

Do you want to learn more about life with this documentation?

Yes: [Arrival.md](Arrival.md)

No: OK. I wish you the best.
