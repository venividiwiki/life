Welcome! Thanks for trusting me with this.

## Reason for life

Let's get straight to the thing life is all about. Many people disagree on this topic. I like to mix some philosophies here.

On the biological side, it is a pretty clear picture. The purpose of most lifeforms is to replicate or to help others with similar DNA to replicate.
This leads to very radical implications (that I don't like) about individuals who aren't able to or don't want to do any of that.
And if we just maximize the offspring we have, we will very quickly overpopulate the planet, leading to very much pain and suffering.

For a single intellent being the answer to the reason of life could also be to maximize its own happiness.
This also leads to problems as soon, as two people have different ideas how to use a limited ressource for their happiness.

You see, its hard to find a statement for the reason for life that has no problems. We might as well say its 42.
