Welcome! Thanks for trusting me with this.

## Reason for life

Let's get straight to the thing life is all about. Many people disagree on this topic. Here are some thoughts:

On the biological side, it is a pretty clear picture. The purpose of most lifeforms is to replicate or to help others with similar DNA to replicate.
This leads to very radical implications (that I don't like) about individuals who aren't able to or don't want to do any of that. Are these individuals useless?
Maybe they make some other individua happy.
Also if we just maximize the offspring we have, we will very quickly overpopulate the planet, leading to very much pain and suffering.

For a single intellent being the answer to the reason of life could also be to maximize its own happiness.
This also leads to problems as soon, as two people have different ideas how to use a limited ressource for their happiness.

You see, its hard to find a statement for the reason for life that has no problems. We might as well say its 42.

All the while it is often easier to decide for onself, what reason we don't want for our lives.
For me thinking about the reason for life is not part of my reason to live.

## Task

It is way harder to reach an unspecified goal, than reaching a specified goal is. 
Therefore the first task for you is to ensure you have a goal at all times.

## Decision

Do you need help finding a goal?
